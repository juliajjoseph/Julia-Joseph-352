<p>Solomon Simmons, 70, and his neighbor Harriett Alexander said McElderry Park used to be more tightknit — “like a village,” Simmons said. Public health studies have shown that without community cohesion, residents are at more risk when temperatures soar. Baltimore health officials say that isolation is always a danger to health. Today, Simmons said, many of his old neighbors have died. Only about four people remain from the group of homeowners his mother met when she moved to McElderry Park in the 1980s. “Pride is gone,” he said.
He will not put an air-conditioning unit in a first-floor window facing the street “because of security.” He has air conditioning in his bedroom, but he’s mindful that using it costs money. “One of the things that does concern me is that my electric bill will probably be a lot more just trying to stay cool.”</p> <br>

<p>He said he didn’t know about cooling centers but would rather take an air-conditioned drive or go to the movies than sit in a cooling center. Alexander, retired from Armco Steel and the Baltimore school system, follows the old Baltimore practice of scrubbing her rowhouse’s white marble steps often. She used to scrub the steps of neighbors’ houses as well. “It’s important to me,” she said. “This is where I live.” She tends large pots of hostas and lilies that bloom next to her rowhouse steps, and on summer days she sits in the shade of a mature sidewalk tree and chats with neighbors. She has air conditioning in her second-floor bedroom but doesn’t like using it because she fears she wouldn’t hear if anyone was breaking into her house.
“I don’t think it safe to live in a house with an air conditioner running, drowning out everything else,” Alexander said. “You don’t know someone’s in your house until they’re in your room.” But especially for children, older residents and people coping with chronic diseases, air conditioning is the answer. </p>

<p>Tammy Jackson, who has asthma, said she had to stop cooking dinner one July evening when the heat made it hard for her to breathe. The next day, she told her husband, “Baby, I can’t cook until I get AC.”
Even if someone from McElderry Park decided to find a cooling center, some centers were closed on the weekend. The closest center open Saturday and Sunday was about a mile away — a long walk for the young or the old in 100-degree heat. Jennifer Martin, Baltimore's deputy health commissioner for population health and disease prevention, said she was “sad and surprised” to hear so many people were unaware of the cooling centers. By the end of July, the health department had declared 12 Code Red days this year, and the department counted 2,454 people who had visited cooling centers. Martin said the health department is working with community groups to find places in addition to city-owned buildings — maybe churches or community associations — where residents could find a place with air conditioning. Those would offer relief closer to home. Scott, the City Council president, said that cooling centers are fine but may not be the answer for everyone. “We have to understand the culture of the neighborhood. Some people are not going to want to be leaving their homes to get cool,” he said. Lewis said, </p>

<p>Twenty people have died of heat-related illnesses in Maryland so far this year, three of them in Baltimore, according to state data through Aug. 28. From July 16 through July 22, when the heat wave broke, 47 people went to emergency rooms when the heat aggravated chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung problems. Yet it could have been worse. Heat catastrophes are not theoretical. In Chicago in 1995, more than 700 people died during a five-day heat wave. And summer heat will get more extreme. With every year, researchers warn, temperatures will soar higher and the heat waves will last longer — putting more pressure on city governments to help residents cope. Historically, the Baltimore area has averaged about six days a year when the heat index exceeded 100 degrees, according to new research from the Union of Concerned Scientists and the University of Idaho. If no action is taken to reduce carbon emissions, by mid-century that figure will rise to more than 37 days annually, according to the researchers. The study defines mid-century as starting in 17 years. By the end of the century, as a baby born today becomes a senior citizen, there will be 65 days with a heat index of 100 degrees or higher, the researchers projected. </p>
